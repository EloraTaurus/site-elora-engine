# Elora Engine Demo (Static)

Static, non-functional demo that mirrors the **current** Elora Engine information architecture and surfaces.

## Included
- Public demo status page (`demo/index.html`)
- Framework overview page (`demo/about.html`)
- Client-side demo chat (scripted responses only)
- Guided walkthroughs (`?tour=...&step=...`) for:
  - Engine snapshot
  - Incident response flow
  - Worker fabric flow
  - Build direction roadmap
- Admin demo with current section groups:
  - Operations: Dashboard, Monitoring, Fabric, Nodes, Security
  - AI Runtime: Models, Pipeline, Knowledge, Memory, Behavior, Plugin, Benchmarks
  - Administration: Operators, Settings, Documentation

## Safety
- No live endpoints
- No secrets
- No real operational data
- No backend writes

Purpose: represent current engine UX and structure with demo-safe content.
